# Hopsan Development Component Libraries
A central repository for experimental Hopsan component libraries that are under more or less active development.

## Disclaimer
This repository contains experimental or special purpose components.

- These components should be considered experimental
- They may not even build
- They may be old and outdated, not working with new Hopsan releases
- They may change at any time
- They may be removed at any time
- They may never get updated
- They may conflict with components in the default or extension library shipped with Hopsan
- Components from these libraries may be moved or copied into the extension or default library shipped with Hopsan at any time

## Adding a new Library
If you want to contribute your own component library do the following:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new branch (with a clever name) from main
3. Add, commit and push your component library in the root directory (next to the existing ones)
